		<td>Oxford - South Korean company, has sets including Titanic and other ships, The Eiffel Tower, an HGV truck. They also make smaller military, police and transport sets, as well as Disney and Hello Kitty. Great bricks that are as good quality as real LEGO, comprehensive instructions, beautiful packaging, and most importantly, well designed models. Also, the company owns Kre-O, which is another LEGO alternative manufacturer.</td>

		<td>Cobi-A Polish company with really good sets  and good quality bricks. This is often peoples’ favourite LEGO alternative. They have an odd range of products, mostly military vehicles and military themes, but they do have regular vehicles like planes, and buses and ships. They even have a Nativity scene kit.

		<td><img src="images/Loz.png" height="100" width="100"> 
		<br></td>
		<td>LOZ & Nanoblocks - These sets, often of little figures or buildings, are made out of lots of tiny bricks, sometimes called nano bricks. They are not LEGO compatible. While these models look quite good, they’re a bit boring to put together for me, and too fiddly for my big fat hands. But if you’ve got the patience and the eyesight, there are so many sets by these companies that you’re bound to find something you want to build.

	<td><img src="images/Kazi.jpg" height="100" width="100"
			> <br></td>
		<td>
			Kazi - They focus mainly on military and city sets, including trains. Lower quality than Cobi, and some of the parts are shockingly cheap. However, a good brand in you’re a fan of tanks, as their models are detailed and well-designed. Note that Kazi mini figures are famous for how awful they are.</td>
		 <tr>
			<td><img src="images/Xingbao.jpg" height="100" width="100"> 
			<br></td>
			<td>They make MOCs by experienced designers, producing some really cool looking kits. The only let down is they use Lepin bricks, which are not as well made as LEGO, and a lot of people have a problem with Lepin as it makes exact clones of LEGO kits.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/Gudi.jpg" height="100" width="100"> 
			<br></td>
			<td>Superb quality bricks and some of the sets around 2015 are really well designed, especially the sci-fi or military kits. But they also do a lot of city stuff and a space shuttle, Again, their mini figures are bad.</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/Sembo-Block.jpg" height="100" width="100"> 
			<br></td>
			<td> Sembo-They do a lot of LEGO cloning, but they are have an amazing original selection of modular buildings, both small and large, and a few vehicles. They are a little dodgy when it comes to the branding they imitate but the kits are really so varied and unlike any other brick company that it makes me want to build my own “LEGO compatible” city.

		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/Kre-O_logo.webp" height="100" width="100"> 
			<br></td>
			<td> This is another comapny that is owned by Oxford so it should ahve excellent brick quality and builds!
				</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td><img src="images/enlighten.jpg" height="100" width="100"> 
			<br></td>
			<td> Enlighten - Originally they released LEGO kits will small alterations, but they’ve branched out into their own designs, which are quite popular. The build quality is excellent. They used to make trains which are now sadly discontinued.
